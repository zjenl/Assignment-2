          <p>The World Happiness Report of 2023 endeavors to shed light on these very questions. The study is conducted

          <p>From the scatter plot, it's evident that there's a positive correlation between a country's GDP per capita 
            and its happiness index. Countries with a GDP per capita in the range of <b>$50k to $100k</b> often exhibit a higher 
            happiness index. Conversely, <b>lower unemployment rates</b>, particularly those below 0.1%, are also indicative of 
            higher happiness scores, suggesting that job security and economic stability are significant contributors 
            to overall well-being. </p>
          <p>Boasting the highest happiness index globally, Australia has a <b>GDP per capita of $54k</b> 
            and an <b>unemployment rate of 5.36%</b>. Such data reinforces the notion that while happiness is multifaceted and 
            influenced by various factors, a robust economy plays a crucial role in enhancing the quality of life and 
            overall satisfaction of its inhabitants.</p>

          <P>CPI (Consumer Price Index) also plays an important role in people's happiness. It is a measure that assesses the 
            average change in prices paid by consumers for goods and services over time. It is vital because it helps determine 
            the purchasing power of money, indicating inflation trends and guiding economic policies. The inflation rate gives
            information about how the country's CPI has changed from 2022 to 2023, with the negative numbers indicating a drop.</P>
          <p>From the parallel plot, we can see that <b>most countries have lower inflation rates (below 2.5%)</b>, and the Consumer 
            Price Index generally exhibits an <b>inverse relationship with the happiness index</b>. Such trends reflect tendency toward 
            price stability and that elevated living costs decreases levels of overall happiness in a country.</p>

          <p>Environment significantly influences people's well-being, with factors like population density and urbanisation
            rate playing key roles. Density refers to the number of people per km squared, and urbanisation rate refers to 
            the percentage of the country's population living in urban areas. Densely populated areas can lead to challenges 
            like overcrowding and noise pollution, reducing people's overall quality of life. Meanwhile, higher urbanisation 
            rate offers better job opportunities and infrastructure, though they also introduce issues such as pollution and 
            high living costs.</p>
          <p>In the heatmap, we can see that <b>most countries have a density between 0-150 people/kmsq</b>, while the urbanisation
            rate is more distributed. Eventhough there isn't a strict linear relationship, we can see that <b>low density and 
            high urbanisation rate</b> are often correlated with higher happiness index of the country.</p>

          <P>Health is fundamental to happiness as it enables individuals to live fulfilling lives, pursue their goals, and 
            enjoy daily activities without physical or mental hindrance. Understanding the main causes of death and average 
            life expectancies provides insights into public health challenges, helping societies prioritise interventions 
            and allocate resources efficiently to enhance the well-being and longevity of their populations.</P>
          <p>From the donut chart, we can see that <b>cardiovascular diseases and neoplasms</b> accounts for most of the deaths in 
            the world. These 2 diseases are the most severe in Europe and Oceania, however in Africa, <b>respiratory infections 
            and tuberculosis</b> replaces neoplasms to take the second rank. We can also see a clear positive correlation between
            life expectancies and happiness index, with Oceania having the highest life expectancy of <b>82.30 years</b> and Africa 
            having the lowest life expectancy of <b>64.31 years</b>.</p>

          <p>Community plays a pivotal role in the happiness index, serving as a foundation for emotional and social well-being. 
            Sense of social support, defined by the World's Happiness Report, is the availability of help and care from family, 
            friends, or communities. Freedom is referred as the ability to make life choices without undue constraints. It also
            includes Human Rights, including the right to life and liberty, freedom from slavery and torture, freedom of opinion 
            and expression, the right to work and education, and many more. These two measures are in the format of a score out 
            of one, and they directly influence individuals' perceptions of happiness. </p>
          <p>From the heatmap, it seems that countries with <b>higher levels of social support and greater freedom to make life 
            choices</b> generally score higher on the happiness index. Additionally, the majority of countries are clustered around 
            higher social support values and moderate freedom levels, indicating these factors might be prevalent across many nations.
            On the other hand, countries with <b>low social support and freedom scores</b> are very likely to have very low happiness

          <P>Safety plays a pivotal role in the happiness index. The criminality score by Global Organised Crime Index, a measure 
            of the prevalence and severity of crimes in a region, can significantly affect happiness; areas with higher criminality 
            often report lower happiness levels due to increased fear and insecurity. Additionally, the size of the armed forces can 
            influence perceptions of safety; a well-sized and equipped military can deter external threats, further enhancing a nation's 
            sense of security and, in turn, its collective happiness.</P>
          <p>From the scatter plot, we can see that in general, <b>lower criminality aligns with greater national happiness</b>, and this

            or crime. Countries like the USA and Australia with moderate sized armed forces boast higher happiness levels, while Afghanistan 
            presents low happiness with high criminality with similar sized armed force. Countries with vast populations like China and India
