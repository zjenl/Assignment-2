        <h1>Global Happiness Index 2023: What Makes People Happy?</h1>
        <p>How happy are people today? How satisfied with their lives are people in different societies? 
          And how do our living conditions affect all of this?</p>
        <p>Digging into these big questions is more than just a curious endeavorâ€”it's deeply personal. 
          In fact, happiness has become a hot topic everywhere, from coffee shop chats to serious economic research.</p>
        <p>The World Happiness Report of 2023 endeavors to shed light on these very questions. The study is conducted 
          by surveying representative samples from diverse nations, with individuals rating their lives on varied 
          parameters and taking the average of these responses. </p>

        <p>From the map above, we can see distinct patterns emerge when looking at continental trends. 
          Oceania, particularly Australia, stands out with the highest happiness index, recording a value of 7.095. 
          This is closely followed by North America, which secures the second position with the index ranging from 6-7. 
          Interestingly, South America exhibits happiness levels akin to Europe, both continents predominantly falling 
          within the 5-7 range. Asia, while vast and diverse, predominantly displays happiness values between 5 and 6. 
          Africa registers the lowest values, with most countries on the continent showing happiness indices mainly in 
          the 3-5 range.</p>
        <p>What leads to such diversity? We are hoping to get a clearer picture of what's driving happiness (or maybe 
          the lack of it) around the globe by zooming in on five key areas: economy, environment, health, community, 
          and safety. By delving into these domains, we aspire to paint a holistic picture of global happiness in 2023, 
          providing insights and unraveling the factors that sculpt the landscape of global contentment. </p>

        <p>
          From the scatter plot, it's evident that there's a positive correlation between a country's GDP per capita 
          and its happiness index. Countries with a GDP per capita in the range of $50k to $100k often exhibit a higher 
          happiness index. Conversely, lower unemployment rates, particularly those below 0.1%, are also indicative of 
          higher happiness scores, suggesting that job security and economic stability are significant contributors to 
          overall well-being. Boasting the highest happiness index globally, Australia has a GDP per capita of $54k 
          and an unemployment rate of 5.36%. Such data reinforces the notion that while happiness is multifaceted and 
          influenced by various factors, a robust economy plays a crucial role in enhancing the quality of life and 
          overall satisfaction of its inhabitants.</p>

          <h2>Trends across Genders</h2>
          <p>One interesting trend is that bullying rates have decreased across the years in all regions and genders. Of
            note
            is that the bullying rate in boys is now 1.9% lower than that in girls, despite starting 2.2% higher. This
            change
            occurred between 2010 and 2011. We speculate that this may be due to the popularisation of social media
            around this
            time, allowing for different avenues of bullying, such as cyberbullying, to emerge. </p>

          <h2>Melbourne Metro Region</h2>
          <p>The Melbourne metropolitan region has generally reported lower bullying rates than across the state,
            despite
            having a range of NAPLAN scores (see above). This may be due to a variety of factors as any factor that
            attracts
            families to the city could be an explanation. Some possible examples are the parents education and
            profession,
            the funding of the school in question, or even the immigration status of students.
          </p>
          <p>
            Within metropolitan Melbourne, KNOX reported the most bullying in 2016 at 22.6%, and Stonnington the least
            at 6%.</p>

          <h2>Decline in Bullying</h2>
          <p>Finally, inspecting the nine most populous LGAs, we find that there has been substantial improvement across
            the years.
            Across all nine LGAs, less than one in five students report having experienced bullying recently, a
            significant improvement. </p>
          <p>
            Melbourne, in particular, has always had low bullying numbers, but has since been joined by Monash; both at
            one student in every eight.
